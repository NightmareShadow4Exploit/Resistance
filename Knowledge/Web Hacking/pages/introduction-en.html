            <p>This course is designed to educate individuals about Website Hacking. Please remember, this knowledge should be used responsibly and ethically — never to exploit others.</p>
            <p>Apply this knowledge for positive and constructive purposes.</p>
        </div>
    
        <p>In this introduction, we will explore how you can begin your journey into the world of Website Hacking.</p>
        <p>If you search for "website hacking" on the internet, you’ll find plenty of resources. But, let me be clear — that information is only the tip of the iceberg.</p>
        <p>From my personal experience, hacking websites effectively requires a deep understanding of the various types of attacks that can be carried out against them.</p>
        <p>Web administrators work tirelessly to secure their sites, but as hackers, we must always stay ahead by learning all possible attack methods.</p>
    
        <br>
    
        <p>Among the many types of attacks, the <strong>OWASP Top 10</strong> stands out as the most critical. These attacks are the most dangerous, posing significant threats to a website's data.</p>
        <p>However, I’ve observed a common pitfall: Since the OWASP Top 10 is widely recognized, many website owners prioritize addressing these vulnerabilities first. But, in doing so, they may overlook other potential weaknesses, ultimately leaving their sites exposed to compromise.</p>
    
        <h2>Where Should We Learn From?</h2>
        <p>There are countless attacks to learn about, and while creating your own testing lab is an excellent way to practice, I recommend starting with PortSwigger's Web Security Labs.</p>
        <p>PortSwigger offers an extensive Security Lab where you can safely practice and learn all kinds of website attacks. You can access it <a href="https://portswigger.net/web-security/all-labs">here</a>.</p>
        
        <br>
    
        <p>Stay with me on this journey, and I’ll guide you through the fundamentals of website hacking. But, a word of caution: mastering website hacking takes time, persistence, and a deep understanding. It’s not something you can rush.</p>
